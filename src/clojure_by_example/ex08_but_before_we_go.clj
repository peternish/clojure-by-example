;; But before we boldly go, here are some resources to help us on our journey!

;; Check out the official website: https://clojure.org

;; It has been accumulating many useful tutorials, guides, book references,
;; community resources, and information about companies using Clojure.

;; Also, here are a few things we really like and find useful to aid understanding
;; at various levels; from the philosophical to the here and now:

;; Talks/Philosphy:
;; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wASCH_gPnDw -- Inside Clojure with Brian Beckman and Rich Hickey
;; https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values -- The Value of Values by Rich Hickey
;; https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Identity-State-Rich-Hickey -- Persistent Data Structures and Managed References by Rich Hickey
;; https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy -- Simple Made Easy by Rich Hickey

;; Debugging:
;;
;; - "Inside-out"/"Bottom-up" REPL-driven debugging, particularly how
;;    Stu Halloway explains, in "Debugging With the Scientific Method".
;;    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FihU5JxmnBg
;;
;; - Aphyr's post is neat!
;;   - Scroll down to the "Debugging Clojure" section:
;;   https://aphyr.com/posts/319-clojure-from-the-ground-up-debugging

;; Handy REPL utils:
;;
;; - clojure.repl/
;;   - source, doc, pp, pprint, print-table
;;   - see the bottom of the `clojure-by-example.utils.core` ns
;;
;; - *1, *2, *3, *e
;;
;; - A sane REPL workflow (buffer/file-based, rather than inside REPL)
