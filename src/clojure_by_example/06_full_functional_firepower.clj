(ns clojure-by-example.ex06-full-functional-firepower)

;; Ex06: Lesson Goals
;; - Introduce multi-arity and variadic functions, and also some
;;   basic de-structuring.
;; - Explain how we can use these to design flexible function
;;   "api"s for good "composability"
;; - Show how to "keep state at the boundary"; e.g.:
;;   - ingest sophisticated planets from a JSON file
;;   ----------------Input boundary----------------
;;   - punch it into a purely functional data processing
;;   - do awesome things with just `map`, `filter`, `reduce`,
;;     simple helper functions (with/without control flow)
;;     and models of the world as pure data structures
;;   ----------------Output boundary---------------
;;   - spit out various kinds of outputs into output files


;; TBD
