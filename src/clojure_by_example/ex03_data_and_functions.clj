;; Ex03: LESSON GOALS
;; - Explore various bits and bobs of the solution interactively
;;   using the live environment at your disposal
;; - Get some ideas of how to take just a handful of pieces,
;;   and build sophisticated logic with them
;; - Debug any issues that might arise
;; - We use only the concepts and standard library functions
;;   we've seen so far, to build purely functional logic
;;   in order to process a bunch of planets:
;;
;;   - Standard Library (about 20 functions):
;;     `def`, `defn`, `fn`, `let`            ; to create/name simple data and small functions
;;     `get`, `get-in`, `assoc`              ; to query and associate data
;;     `map`, `filter`, `reduce`             ; to operate on collections
;;     `if`, `when`, `cond`                  ; to decide things
;;     `not`, `and`, `empty?`, `<=`, `count` ; for logic and quantities
;;     `comp`, `complement`                  ; to glue higher-order logic
;;
;;   - Concepts:
;;     - Compute only with pure functions:
;;       - Build higher-order logic with higher order functions
;;       - Lexical scope and function closures to maximize modularity
;;     - Collections as functions:
;;       - Keywords as functions of hash-maps
;;       - Well-defined Sets as predicates --- tests of set membership
;;     - Hash-maps and collections to model domain entities:
;;       - A planet, or atmospheric tolerances, or decision tables,
;;         or collections of analysis criteria
;;     - Truthy / Falsey logic:
;;       - Instead of only Boolean true/false
;;     - Namespaces:
;;       - Making use of things defined elsewhere
;;
;;   - Workflow:
;;     - Apply the Scientific Method to design, debug, and to understand
;;     - Run small fast experiments via the REPL
;;     - Preserve your experiments in-line within your codebase itself

  ;; BACKGROUND
  ;;
  ;; The Office of Interstellar Affairs (OIA) is pushing hard
  ;; for all-out space exploration and colonization.
  ;;
  ;; The OIA intends to issue "mission directives"...
  ;;
  ;; They wish humanity to :inhabit, or :colonise, or :probe,
  ;; or :observe a given planet based on their analysis of
  ;; available planetary data.
  ;;
  ;; For a given "mission directive", like :probe, the OIA
  ;; intends to dispatch a collection of vessels.

  ;; GOAL
  ;;
  ;; Prototype a bit of planetary analysis logic, using criteria
  ;; that interest the OIA, such that they will be able to decide
  ;; what to do about a given planet.
  ;;
  ;; Criteria include questions like:
  ;; - co2-tolerable?
  ;; - gravity-tolerable?
  ;; - surface-temp-tolerable?
  ;;
  ;; How a planet stands up to such questions will let us assess
  ;; whether it is habitable? or colonisable? or observe-only?.
  ;;
  ;; Once we deliver the OIA our assessment, they may choose to
  ;; dispatch one or more kinds of Starfleet vessels to the planet.
  )

;; Here are some target planets:
clojure-by-example.data.planets/target-planets

;; Which we can access more conveniently as:
p/target-planets

(comment
  ;; It's time to learn how Clojure allows us to debug and understand our programs, using nothing more
  ;; than the REPL and our wits.

  ;; Let's look at our results again, shall we? Are we really only deploying probes and orbiters?

  (map assign-vessels p/target-planets)

  ;; That's a bit hard to visually parse, how about this:

  (map :mission-vessels (map assign-vessels p/target-planets))

  ;; The OIA is right! But why is this happening?
  ;; Either our directive to fleet mapping is wrong, or our issued directives are wrong.

  starfleet-mission-configurations

  ;; The configurations look fine. What about the directives?

  (map :mission-directive (map assign-vessels p/target-planets))

  ;; We're only probing and observing! Clearly issue-mission-directive is at fault.
  ;; Let's take a look at its source code again.

  ;; Does this mean that there are no planets which our code considers habitable or colonisable?

  ;; EXERCISE:
  ;; Check whether we have any habitable or colonisable planets according to the habitable? and colonisable? predicates.

  ;; Apparently we don't!
  ;; At the very least, the planet Earth should be both habitable and colonisable.
  ;; At least now we know that habitable? and colonisable? are problematic. But why? Let's look at their implementation.
  ;; We'll narrow in on habitable? for the time being, and worry about colonisable? later.

  ;; A planet is habitable iff:
  ;; 1. It has an atmosphere
  ;; 2. The air is not too poisonous
  ;; 3. The carbon dioxide, gravity and temperature levels are all tolerable

  ;; The following issues are possible:
  ;; 1. planet-meets-any-one-condition? is broken.
  ;; 2. planet-meets-no-condition? is broken.
  ;; 3. minimal-good-conditions is broken.
  ;; 4. fatal-conditions is broken.
  ;; 5. Any or all of the above.

  ;; EXERCISE: Check if planet-meets-any-one-condition? works correctly.
  ;; planet-meets-any-one-condition? accepts predicates as a parameter, and doesn't care about the predicates
  ;; themselves. Because of this, we can simplify our debugging by using simple and obvious predicates,
  ;; rather than using the predicates in the production code.

  ;; EXERCISE: Check if planet-meets-no-condition? works correctly.

  ;; If none of those work, clearly there's something wrong with our conditions themselves.

  ;; EXERCISE: Diagnose and fix the broken conditions.

  ;; Does everything work now?

;; - REPL all the things!
;;   Especially understand how the Clojure REPL is a powerful debugging tool
;;   that supersedes more traditional step-through debuggers in many ways.
;;
;; You can:
;; 1. Test individual functions or constants to check if they're correct.
;; 2. Redefine a function to add tracing such as print statements, or other forms of instrumentation.
;; 3. Capture intermediate values such as function arguments or let bindings, and inspect them in the REPL
;;    after the fact.
;; 4. Fix the problem and verify that it works immediately.
;; 5. Do all of the above either locally, or while connected to a remote server running in a staging or
;;    production environment.

;; We strongly recommend going through https://clojure.org/guides/repl/enhancing_your_repl_workflow#debugging-tools-and-techniques
