(ns clojure-by-example.ex05-immutability-and-fp)

;; Ex05: Lesson Goals
;; - Connect back to previous exercises and show how we did
;;   whatever we needed, without mutating anything, and without any
;;   side-effects
;; - Explain how "pure functions" are just functions of data -> data
;; - Explain `def`, and why global definitions should be used sparingly
;; - Introduce let bindings and lexical scope, to show how to keep
;;   "function-local things", local to the function
;; - Show where mutability is useful; e.g. I/O

;; TBD

;; Where to explain DEBUGGING and ERROR MESSAGES??!!
