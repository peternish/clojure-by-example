# clojure_by_example

What could one do with just _little_ bit of Clojure?

Goals
  - Acquire a "feel" of Clojure, for further self-study/exploration.
  - Learn how Clojurists usually think with Clojure to solve problems.
  - See how it's not so hard to do surprisingly powerful things with a
    mere handful of "primitive" functions, data structures, and ideas.

Anti-Goals
  - Try to explain Functional Programming theory or Clojure's innards.
    (Many free and paid tutorials and books do so very well.)
  - Try to fully cover Clojure primitives/features. (That's homework!)
  - Devolve into language wars, editor wars, syntax wars, type wars...
    (Life's too short, people.)
  - Focus too much on tooling or operational things. (At least not 
    while there's fun to be had!) 

# How to use this?

Think of this as an exercise in "constrained creativity".
  - Ignore details, achieve much with as little know-how as possible.
  - Focus on what things do; not what they are, or why they are.
  - Inform your _intuition for doing things_, and then use that to 
    dive deeper into all the juicy details at your own pace, later.
  - Take what is useful, discard the rest.

# Philosophy

Almost anyone can hope to do more with more. Up to a point, that is.

Far too often, we end up doing _less_ with more; bogged down by the
complexity and blinding glitter of too much choice, and overabundance.

Figuring out how to do more with less, feeds our curiosity, and often
satisfies and empowers us more than we care to admit. (Oddly, this is
also a trait of people who build amazing things that last and grow,
or open entirely new avenues of human progress.)

So, may you stay small and achieve important things.

Live long, and prosper.
